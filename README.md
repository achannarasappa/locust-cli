## Features

### Generate a job definition file

Interactively generate a job definition file with `locust generate` by answering a set of prompts.

### Test CSS selectors and data extraction logic 

Running a job with `locust run` makes a request to the entrypoint url and runs the `extract` hook which is a lightweight way to test that the defined CSS selectors and other data extraction logic works as expected.

### Start a job locally before pushing to a cloud provider

Simulate and debug a job run on a cloud provider without pushing up code or provisioning infrastructure. `locust start` will run a job as it would on a cloud provider and presents a dashboard to help understand what the job is doing and identify potential problem areas.
